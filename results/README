The files in this folder are named by the given benchmark, see benchs.lib for 
more details on characteristic, ordering, variables.
File names ending with an "h" denote the homogenized versions of the
respective benchmark.

The files include data sets of computations with
--------------------------------------------
1. incremental sba using F5's criteria
2. incremental sba using Arri's critiera
3. non-incremental sba using F5's criteria
4. non-incremental sba using Arri's criteria
--------------------------------------------

All computations were done on a compute server with the following 
specifications:
----------------------------------------------------
- 2.6.31-gentoo-r6 GNU/Linux 64-bit operating system
- INTEL XEON X5460 at 3.16 GHz processor
- 64 GB RAM
- 128 GB swap space
----------------------------------------------------

All timings are given in 1/1000 seconds.
